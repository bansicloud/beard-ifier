# Beard-ifier
Were you made for facial hair? Well there's only one way to find out: **[my online beard-ifier](https://i8sumpi.github.io/faceDetect/beard.html)**. 

For this project, my internet was too slow to download a facial recognition dataset, so I used [face-api.js](https://github.com/justadudewhohacks/face-api.js). 

face-api gives 68 reference points of the face. For example, there are points that may represent the center of the eye, or the bottom of the chin. I was able to combine these 
reference points into the shape of a beard, and then draw it using the HTML5 canvas. After looking at tons of pictures of beards on the internet (I now get lots of ads for beard 
products), I was able to design/copy my favorite 5 beard styles! 

Hope you enjoy!
